# CURRENTLY VERY WORK IN PROGRESS, DO NOT USE ON PRODUCTION SERVERS AS IT MAY RESET PLAYER INVENTORIES.
This plugin is HEAVILY WIP and despite over 200+ hours being put into it already it is still very buggy and player inventories may be reset due to tanks and planes using custom items.

You can compile it and put it onto your servers if you like, however I cannot help if player inventories or any other problems arise as a result.

# Planes
Planes currently use a Speed + Angle system, they will follow where the player looks and gain / loose speed depending on their angle relative to the ground.
They also have Missile Support and can fire Shells at ground vehicles and other aircraft.

**Crashing**

Aircraft can crash into terrain, causing powerful explosions as it rips through the ground.

# Tanks
Tanks are able to move over 1 block gaps and are able to collide with terrain as they move.
Tanks have functional turrets with differing traverse speed.
Players can choose to sit outside the tank hatch for better visibility however must then sacrifice their invulnerability if they choose to do so.

# Cars and Trucks
Cars and Trucks follow a simple movement model, shared by tanks.
Some vehicles can traverse either over Slabs, Blocks or no elevation. 
Cars and Trucks have trailer support although this is currently unused due to difficulties with the saving of their inventories. 

#  Menus
Every vehicle has a vehicle menu associated with it, to access it crouch + right click on a vehicles entrance slot and you can refuel, rearm and repair your vehicle.

# Fuel Mechanics
All fuels can be used to power all vehicles, however each fuel have different "densities"
If you choose to run your plane on a low-density diesel fuel expect it to not get very far due to a small fuel tank, however run it on high-density jet fuel and it will use up that small tank much slower!

This makes the type of fuel to choose a economic problem as rich players may choose to run their vehicles on jet fuel to save on the amount of time they need to refuel the vehicle
