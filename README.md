# MineThunder
AKA: Realistic Vehicles

Adds Semi-Realistic planes, cars and tanks to Minecraft!

# CURRENTLY VERY WORK IN PROGRESS, DO NOT USE ON PRODUCTION SERVERS AS IT MAY RESET PLAYER INVENTORIES.

Planes follow the cursor and have flight mechanics

All vehicles have "damage models" that gives tanks and planes hit mechanics similar to war thunder, the vehicles dont have health but instead have armour and vital components that can be shot at!
